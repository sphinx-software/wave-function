# WaveFunction

A testing framework for Fusion.

*FYI, in quantum physics, **wave function** is a mathematical description of the quantum state of a system.*

***WaveFunction** created for making a unify, simple, clean and predicable testing framework for Fusion. Which will describe your Fusion based application in a very natural and logical way.*

*We hope so, at least* :smiley_cat:
